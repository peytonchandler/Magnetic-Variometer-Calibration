# Spring 2026 Capstone Design Project  
**Calibrating Magnetic Variometers Using Quantitative Error Metrics**

## Overview
This project investigates how to better calibrate magnetic variometers so that their measurements approach the accuracy of full magnetic observatories. By developing quantitative metrics that characterize and constrain variometer error, we aim to improve confidence in low-cost magnetic monitoring systems and support broader deployment across the United States.

## Research Question
**What quantitative metrics can be developed to better calibrate magnetic variometers so that their performance approaches the accuracy of magnetic observatories?**
---

## Motivation
Magnetic observatories provide highly accurate, *absolute* measurements of the Earth’s magnetic field vector and derived total field. However, observatories require expensive instrumentation and infrastructure, resulting in sparse coverage across the United States.

Magnetic variometers offer a low-cost and easy-to-deploy alternative for monitoring geomagnetic variations. However:
- They measure only **relative temporal changes**, not absolute field values.
- Their data are susceptible to drift.
- They require calibration against an absolute reference.

To expand the usefulness of variometer networks, we must quantify how well they track true geomagnetic variations. Developing error metrics will help:
- Improve calibration procedures  
- Increase confidence in variometer-derived data  
- Support wider deployment of inexpensive magnetic monitoring systems

## Objectives
1. Identify and evaluate quantitative metrics that characterize the error between variometer measurements and observatory data.  
2. Assess how these metrics vary under different geomagnetic conditions.  
3. Develop recommendations for improving variometer calibration and long-term stability.  
4. Provide guidance for future deployment strategies of low-cost magnetic sensors.

## Methods (Planned)
- Data collection from magnetic variometers and observatories  
- Preprocessing and time-alignment  
- Statistical comparison (RMSE, cross-correlation, drift quantification, etc.)  
- Frequency-domain and spectral analysis  
- Evaluation across geomagnetic disturbance levels  
- Recommendations for calibration workflows
